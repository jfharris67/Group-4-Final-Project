# Group-4-Final-Project

# Title:  January 2020 Flight Predictions: Flight Delays, Best and Worst Airports and Airlines

# I.	SEGMENT 1 DELIVERABLES:  COMPLETED

## A.	Project Overview 
*Finalize projects idea including what is your dataset, what are the problems you’re solving, and what will be the predictive problem you will solve.

As a collective, Group 4 decided to do the following:
January 2020 Flight Predictions:
1.	Predictive Problem:  Flight Delays
2.	Best and Worst Airlines
3.	Best and Worst Airports

## B.	ER Diagram and Database Setup
*Create an ER diagram and setup database for your data (if applicable)

1.	John Harris created the ER diagrams using pgAdmin 
2.	John Harris setup the database using AWS

### ER Diagram below:

- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
- from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
- from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
- from xgboost import XGBClassifier
- from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

## E.	Github
*Continue to use Github for all the data

1.	Marcia Joseph responsible for keeping Group 4’s project deliverable READ.me logs updated.
2.	John Harris is the Github Manager

## Additions:
