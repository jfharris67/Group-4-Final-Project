# Group-4-Final-Project

# Title:  January 2020 Flight Predictions: Flight Delays, Best and Worst Airports and Airlines

# I.	SEGMENT 1 DELIVERABLES:  COMPLETED

## A.	Project Overview 
*Finalize projects idea including what is your dataset, what are the problems you’re solving, and what will be the predictive problem you will solve.

As a collective, Group 4 decided to do the following:

January 2020 Flight Predictions:
1.	Predictive Problem:  Flight Delays for the total flights in January 2020
2.	Determine the Best and Worst Airlines for flight delays
3.	Determine the Best and Worst Airports for flight delays

## B.	ER Diagram and Database Setup
*Create an ER diagram and setup database for your data (if applicable)

1.	John Harris created the ER diagrams using Quick DBD
2.	John Harris setup the database using AWS

### ER Diagram below:

## C.	Visualization Board
*Create a rough outline of your visualization dashboard

1.	Kennan Foust will create a visualization dashboard outline using Tableau
2.	Group will review, provide feedback and make edits.

## D.	Machine Learning Model
*Create a paper-based mockup of your machine learning model

1.	John Harris set up the machine learning model mockup
2.	We've have been testing different models to see what will work best for the data we have.
3.	Group will review, provide feedback and make edits

### Machine Learning Models we have used and/or tested for for project are listed below:
- Logistic Regression Model
- Random Forest Classifier Model
- Gradient Boosting Classifier Model

## E.	Github
*Continue to use Github for all the data

1.	Marcia Joseph responsible for keeping Group 4’s project deliverable READ.me logs updated.
2.	John Harris is the Github Manager
